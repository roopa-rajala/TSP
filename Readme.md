Two algorithms are implemented to find solve the travelling salesman problem.
1. Genetic Algorithm as Soph
2. Greedy Algorithm as Simple
There are three cost functions used to determine the weight between the edges. The cost functions are in the file costfunctions.txt. You can change that in Simple.cpp and Sophisticated.cpp. Source Code is in src folder. MyForm.h shows the UI components. Simple.cpp enhances about greedy search algorithm and genetic Algorithm is implemented in Sophisticated.h which uses crossover and mutation. You can change the population size and number of generations to be created in the code. 0.05 is the Mutation rate. Seed value takes the input of where to start the journey.
